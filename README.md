Stage plotter is a single-page application built utilizing a React front end and a Rails API on the back end.

The app is designed for musicians to quickly and intuitively construct a diagram of the layout of how they plan to position their equipment on stage.

Each newly created plot generates a unique url that the user can bookmark and save for later. Stage Plots can be converted to PDF and downloaded to be shared with music venues.

The repo for the backend API of this project can be found [here](https://www.github.com/skel11417/todo-app)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
